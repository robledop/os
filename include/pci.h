//  Bit 0, RW: I/O Space. If set to 1 the device can respond to I/O Space accesses; otherwise, the device's
// response is disabled.
#define PCI_COMMAND_IO 0x1
// Bit 1, RW: Memory Space. If set to 1 the device can respond to Memory Space accesses; otherwise, the device's
// response is disabled.
#define PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY 0x2
// Bit 2, RW: Bus Master. If set to 1 the device can behave as a bus master; otherwise, the device can not
// generate PCI accesses.
#define PCI_COMMAND_BUS_MASTER 0x4
// Bit 3, RO: Special Cycle. If set to 1 the device can monitor Special Cycle operations; otherwise,
// the device will ignore them.
#define PCI_COMMAND_SPECIAL_CYCLES 0x8
// Bit 4, RW: Memory Write and Invalidate enable. If set to 1 the device can generate the Memory Write and
// Invalidate command; otherwise, the Memory Write command must be used.
#define PCI_COMMAND_MEM_WRITE_INVALIDATE 0x10
// Bit 5, RW: VGA Palette Snooping. If set to 1 the device does not respond to palette register writes and will
// snoop the data; otherwise, the device will treat palette write accesses like all other accesses.
#define PCI_COMMAND_VGA_PALETTE_SNOOP 0x20
// Bit 6, RW: Parity Error Response. If set to 1 the device will take its normal action when a parity error is
// detected; otherwise, when an error is detected, the device will set bit 15 of the Status register
// (Detected Parity Error Status Bit), but will not assert the PERR# (Parity Error) pin and will continue
// operation as normal.
#define PCI_COMMAND_PARITY_ERROR_RESPONSE 0x40
// Bit 8, RW: SERR# Enable. If set to 1 the SERR# driver is enabled; otherwise, the driver is disabled.
#define PCI_COMMAND_SERR 0x100
// Bit 9, RO: Fast Back-to-Back Enable. If set to 1 indicates a device is allowed to generate fast back-to-back
// transactions; otherwise, fast back-to-back transactions are only allowed to the same agent.
#define PCI_COMMAND_FAST_BACK 0x200
// Bit 10, RW: Interrupt Disable. If set to 1 the assertion of the devices INTx# signal is disabled; otherwise,
// assertion of the signal is enabled.
#define PCI_COMMAND_INTERRUPT_DISABLE 0x400

// Represents the state of the device's INTx# signal. If set to 1 and bit 10 of the Command register
//(Interrupt Disable bit) is set to 0 the signal will be asserted; otherwise, the signal will be ignored.
#define PCI_STATUS_INTERRUPT 0x8
// If set to 1 the device implements the pointer for a New Capabilities Linked list at offset 0x34; otherwise,
// the linked list is not available.
#define PCI_STATUS_CAPABILITIES_LIST 0x10
// If set to 1 the device is capable of running at 66 MHz; otherwise, the device runs at 33 MHz.
#define PCI_STATUS_66MHZ 0x20
// If set to 1 the device can accept fast back-to-back transactions that are not from the same agent; otherwise,
// transactions can only be accepted from the same agent.
#define PCI_STATUS_FAST_BACK 0x80
// This bit is only set when the following conditions are met. The bus agent asserted PERR# on a read or observed an
// assertion of PERR# on a write, the agent setting the bit acted as the bus master for the operation in which the error
// occurred, and bit 6 of the Command register (Parity Error Response bit) is set to 1.
#define PCI_STATUS_PARITY_ERROR 0x100
// DEVSEL Timing - Read only bits that represent the slowest time that a device will assert DEVSEL# for any bus command
// except Configuration Space read and writes. Where a value of 0x0 represents fast timing, a value of 0x1 represents
// medium timing, and a value of 0x2 represents slow timing.

// This bit will be set to 1, by a master device, whenever its transaction is terminated with Target-Abort.

// This bit will be set to 1 whenever the device asserts SERR#
#define PCI_STATUS_SIG_SYSTEM_ERROR 0x4000
